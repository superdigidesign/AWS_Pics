SVC205 - Developing Intelligent Robots with AWS RoboMaker

Robots are now becoming prevalent in our lives, helping us perform tedious housework, distribute warehouse inventory, automate manufacturing, and research lunar landscapes. These applications demand a high level of intelligence and autonomy, and until now, developing, testing, and deploying intelligent robotics applications was difficult and time consuming. AWS RoboMaker is a new cloud robotics service that makes it easy for developers to develop, test, and deploy robotics applications and build intelligent robotics functions using cloud services. In this session, we dive into how customers are using AWS RoboMaker to accelerate development timelines and build innovative robotics solutions.
